          <h1>What is the body mass index (BMI)?</h1>
          <p class="special">
            The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and
            weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation
            divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres
            squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
          </p>
          <h2>BMI ranges</h2>
          <p class="special">
            For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range. For
            children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes
            into account age and gender as well as height and weight. If your
            BMI is: below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range between 18.5
            and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range between 25 and 29.9 –
            you're in the overweight range between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the
            obese range If you want to calculate your BMI, try our healthy
            weight calculator.
          </p>
          <h2>Accuracy of BMI</h2>
          <p class="special">
            BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a
            healthy weight range for a particular height. As well as measuring
            your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into
            account when assessing if you're a healthy weight. Muscle is much
            denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight
            boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even
            though their BMI is classed as obese. Your ethnic group can also
            affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of
            South Asian origin may have a higher risk of some health problems,
            such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is usually considered
            healthy. You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get
            advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your
            weight.
